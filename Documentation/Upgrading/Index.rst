Upgrading from tt_products
==========================

If the legacy ``tt_products`` extension (and its tables) are still present in the installation,
ten upgrade wizards under :guilabel:`Admin Tools > Upgrade` migrate its data into this
extension's tables. The migration wizards are idempotent (safe to run more than once) and skip
themselves entirely once the legacy tables are gone.

Run order
=========

Run the wizards in this order — each one links its rows back to the previous one via a shared
:sql:`tx_products_migration_map` table, so records must exist before they can be referenced:

#.  **Seed tax classes** (``products_initialTaxClasses``) — creates the standard/reduced/zero tax
    classes products are linked to.
#.  **Migrate categories** (``products_ttProductsCategoryMigration``) — ``tt_products_cat`` and its
    ``tt_products_cat_language`` translations.
#.  **Migrate products** (``products_ttProductsProductMigration``) — ``tt_products`` and its
    ``tt_products_language`` translations, linked to the migrated categories and tax classes.
#.  **Migrate articles** (``products_ttProductsArticleMigration``) — ``tt_products_articles`` and
    its ``tt_products_articles_language`` translations, linked to the migrated products.
#.  **Migrate orders** (``products_ttProductsOrderMigration``) — ``sys_products_orders`` and its
    line items, linked to the migrated products/articles.
#.  **Migrate media** (``products_ttProductsMediaMigration``) — product/category/article images and
    product datasheets, linked to the already-migrated categories/products/articles. Run this
    before the cleanup wizard, since it needs the other wizards' :sql:`tx_products_migration_map`
    rows to know where each legacy record ended up.
#.  **Migrate visited-product counters** (``products_ttProductsVisitedProductsMigration``) —
    :sql:`sys_products_visited_products` (global view counts) and
    :sql:`sys_products_fe_users_mm_visited_products` (per-user view counts), remapping legacy
    product uids to migrated ones.
#.  **Migrate plugin content elements** (``products_ttProductsPluginMigration``) — rewrites the
    legacy FlexForm-driven plugin elements (:sql:`CType='list'` with :sql:`list_type` ``5``,
    ``tt_products_pi_int`` or ``tt_products_pi_search``) into this extension's single-purpose
    content types. A legacy element could select several display modes at once and rendered them
    one after another, so such an element becomes one new element per mode. Its product and
    category selections are remapped to the migrated records, which is why this wizard runs after
    the category and product wizards. Elements selecting a mode without an equivalent here (gift
    vouchers, the DAM and address-book families, the ``USER1``-``USER5`` hook slots) are left
    completely untouched and reported with their uid and page, for manual review.

    ..  warning::
        Run this wizard **before upgrading the site to TYPO3 v14.** TYPO3 v14 removes the
        :sql:`tt_content.list_type` column, and legacy ``tt_products`` never registered its
        plugins any other way — not even in its final v13 release. Once that column is gone,
        these elements can no longer be identified and must be rebuilt by hand.

#.  **Drop legacy tables** (``products_ttProductsLegacyCleanup``, optional) — a confirmable wizard
    that permanently drops the migrated ``tt_products``/``tt_products_cat``/``tt_products_articles``/
    ``sys_products_orders`` and visited-product tables (and their ``_language``/``mm`` siblings) once
    every wizard above reports nothing left to migrate. It refuses to run while any of them still has
    pending work, but it cannot verify media migration completeness automatically (see below) - run
    the media wizard first and confirm its output looks complete before confirming this one. Tables
    this extension never migrates at all (gifts, vouchers, the old graduated-price mechanism) are
    left untouched; remove them manually if no longer needed.

Known limitations
==================

*   **Secondary thumbnails and slider images are not migrated.** Legacy ``smallimage`` (products,
    articles) and ``sliderimage`` (categories) are redundant pre-generated thumbnails of the main
    image; FAL generates thumbnails on demand, so only the main ``image`` (and, for products, the
    ``datasheet``) is migrated. The media wizard logs a notice for every legacy record that had one.
*   **Duplicate translations are resolved deterministically.** Legacy ``*_language`` tables have no
    uniqueness constraint on (parent, language). When duplicates exist, a non-hidden row always wins
    over a hidden one, and the highest uid wins among equally-visible candidates; the losing rows are
    reported, not migrated.
*   **Every migrated order uses the "invoice" payment method**, since it is the only payment method
    this extension implements. The wizard logs a warning for orders that actually used a different
    (electronic) payment gateway; the original gateway is preserved in the order's
    ``legacy_order_data`` field but is not re-creatable as a working payment method.
*   **Line item prices are not reconstructed from history.** The legacy ``orderData`` blob's price
    breakdown is a site- and version-specific serialized structure that cannot be parsed reliably, so
    migrated order line items use the *current* catalog price with an explanatory note instead of the
    price that was actually charged historically.
*   **Only one address per order.** The legacy schema only ever stored a single address; it becomes
    the order's billing address; no delivery address is created.
*   **Legacy country names are free text.** They are matched against TYPO3's country list where
    possible; anything that doesn't match is kept verbatim in the order's ``legacy_country_name``
    field instead of a resolved ISO country code.
