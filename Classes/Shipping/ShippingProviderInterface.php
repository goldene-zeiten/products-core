/**
 * Contract for shipping carriers. Shipping is shop-specific, so a carrier lives in its own extension and
 * plugs in here; the autoconfigure tag on this interface collects it with no further configuration.
 *
 * Who decides what:
 *
 * - The carrier decides what it can carry. Only it knows its own weight caps, its zones and the goods it
 *   refuses, so {@see ShippingProviderInterface::quote()} returns only options it can actually serve and
 *   an empty array when it can serve none. The extension never second-guesses that.
 * - The customer decides which option to use, from every carrier's options collected into one list.
 * - The shop decides which one is preselected, and what it charges on top of the carrier's rate.
