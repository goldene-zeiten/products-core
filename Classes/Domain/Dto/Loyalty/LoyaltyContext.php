/**
 * What a loyalty programme needs to decide both of its directions: what a customer earns from an order,
 * and what they may spend on it. The request travels with it, because a programme's own configuration -
 * how much a point is worth, how points are earned - is the programme's business and not something the
 * core could put in the context for it.
 *
 * The remaining goods total is what is left after discounts, so points are spent against what the
 * customer actually still owes rather than the pre-discount total.
